This folder contains the core FSM logic
The timing diagram confirms the logical correctness of the design.
The system is designed to detect specific 4-bit sequence(1-0-1-1).If the sequence is incorrect the locked signal remains high.

This logic is synthesizable, it can be mapped to flip flops on FPGA or ASIC
